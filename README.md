# PABAS Energy – Landing Page

This repository contains the public landing page for **PABAS Energy**, a modular thermochemical concept for the co-valorization of textile waste and biomass.

The site is static (HTML/CSS) and includes:
- `index.html` – main landing page  
- `thank-you.html` – redirect page for form submissions  
- `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` for SEO basics  
- `/assets` – images, favicon, and visual material  

This repo serves as the official lightweight presentation of the project.  
The goal is to share the concept, gather contacts, and support early validation and partnerships.

Deployed via GitHub Pages at **pabasenergy.com**.
